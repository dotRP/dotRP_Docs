# dotRP Known Issues

## Inventories and Spawn Location  

Odd error with inventory, it doesn't seem to be saving new items added into player inventories or spawn locations  


## Custom Number Plates  

Please make sure when adding custom plates you take note of the original plate
When adding custom numberplats the use of certain special charaters break the car  
When adding custom plates the odd car fails to add core vech flags, a sell and rebuy normally fixes it (we would repay the money), if this doesnt work please let us know the original plate and new plate  


## Sever showing offline
Small FiveM Bug
Server might show offline when its not (pretty much unless its just restarted its probs online)
connecting via launcher seems to fix this
