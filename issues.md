## Custom Number Plates  

Please make sure when adding custom plates you take note of the original plate
When adding custom numberplats the use of certain special charaters break the car  
Wehn adding custom plates the odd car fails to add core vech flags, a sell and rebuy normally fixes it (we would repay the money), if this doesnt work please let us know the original plate and new plate
