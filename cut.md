# Cut

We use the phrase "cut" in our server, this is a way to stop incidents that are making people feel uncomfortable, to get scenarios back on track, in some cases stop a scenario some things can be cleaned up, to pause a scenario, in a situation that cannot be reasonably fixed within roleplay,  to reset an scenario or the most common case would be to debrief after something has reached its logical conclusion.  

ANY Character involved in a situation can call cut and all players must stop and honour the cut.
This would could be called a staff sit in some servers.
In the case of a game crash, it would be a good idea to call a cut!

This would NOT be appropriate to be used in a "loose" situation, IE A Criminal has been cornered by the police and about to be arrested, but (may) be appropriate in the case of an unarmed store robbery where police come in and shoot the criminal with no provocation.  
In any case this may be a better place for a logical conclusion debrief rather than mid scenario.

If you are feeling genuinely uncomfortable you can call cut at anytime.

and this is obviously not a hard list and more will be added here for clarification as we go.

## Example 1 - Not able to be fixed within roleplay  

Here Mach (Fire Chief Slater), Ash (Det Cassie) and a police informant had been investigating bunkers because of intelligence that they were going to be used for a kidnapping.  
It made send that Slater knew where the bunkers were due to his background and thus he was accompanying Cassie.  
Upon visiting known locations they came across a bunker, this happened to be the arms dealer's bunker (of whom Slater knew of through yet to be revealed). However without thinking they entered the bunker. -Now this was a mistake as 1) the police entered without a good reason and without a warrant 2) the broke in (which they didn't realize until pointed out in chat as no way would the arms dealer leave there bunker unlocked, but the script in use didn't allow us to RP that)  

here is the discussion that followed, cut is called at about 6 minutes.
